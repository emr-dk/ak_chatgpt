Here we try to follow along as Andrej Karpathy in his Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out, found (here)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY]

The foundational model is based on this article here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762 

We will try to create a probabilisitc transformer-based model. Not at the scale of ChatGPT (obviously).

* NanoGPT

We will be downloading the dataset of tinyshakespeare:
